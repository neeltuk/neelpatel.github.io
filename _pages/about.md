Hey, I am Neel, a CS PhD student in the [USC Theory Group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Shaddin Dughmi](http://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~shaddin/) and [David Kempe](http://david-kempe.com). I am broadly interested in Combinatorial Optimization in the presence of Uncertainty or Incentives, Algorithmic Contract Theory, and Dynamic Graph Algorithms.  I am also passionate about Ethics in AI/ML.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent wonderful almost one and a half years at the National University of Singapore as a Research Assistant working with [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/) and [Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/). Before that, I completed my B.Stat at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
